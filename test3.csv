"And it's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, whoa-oh",It's a cruel summer
"Wish We could turn back time
To the good old days
When Our Mama sang us to sleep",But now we're stressed out
"I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights, 
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch","No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch"
Now you're just somebody that I used to know,Somebody that I used to know
"So you're a tough guy, 
Like it really rough guy, 
Just can't get enough guy","I'm the bad guy, duh"
"I'm waking up, I feel it in my bones, 
Enough to make my system blow","Welcome to the new age, to the new age"
"We could have had it all, 
Rolling in the deep",You had my heart inside of your hand
"I'm in love with the shape of you, 
We push and pull like a magnet do",I'm in love with your body
"Is this the real life? 
Is this just fantasy?","Caught in a landslide, no escape from reality"
"Take me to church, I'll worship like a dog 
At the shrine of your lies",I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
"Coming out of my cage, 
And I've been doing just fine",Gotta gotta be down because I want it all
"Can't stop, addicted to the shindig, 
Chop top, he says I'm gonna win big",This life is more than just a read-through
"With the lights out, it's less dangerous, 
Here we are now, entertain us",I feel stupid and contagious
"I'm gonna fight 'em off, 
A seven nation army couldn't hold me back",And I'm talking to myself at night
"Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep, 
Dreaming about the things that we could be","But baby, I've been, I've been dreaming cars"
